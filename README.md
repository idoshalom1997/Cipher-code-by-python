# Natural Text Analysis and Cipher Cracking Tool
## Overview
This project, developed as part of the Intro to Programming course at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, focuses on creating a tool for the statistical analysis of natural texts in the English language. The tool is designed to decipher ciphertext substitution ciphers by deducing the source of each letter through statistical analysis.

## Algorithm Description
A substitution cipher replaces each English letter in the original text with another English letter in the encrypted text. To crack the cipher, the tool keeps statistics of letters and words in the English language. It attempts to decipher the text in various ways and identifies correct decryption based on similarities in lexical and statistical characteristics with the English language.
For example, common English words and letters are expected to appear frequently in decrypted text. The tool utilizes dictionaries and statistical frequencies to make educated guesses about the mapping between encrypted and original letters.
